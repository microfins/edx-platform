        In a numerical input problem, learners enter numbers or a specific and relatively simple mathematical expression. Learners enter the response in plain text, and the system then converts the text to a symbolic expression that learners can see below the response field.

        The system can handle several types of characters, including basic operators, fractions, exponents, and common constants such as "i". You can refer learners to "Entering Mathematical and Scientific Expressions" in the edX Guide for Students for more information.

        When you add the problem, be sure to select Settings to specify a Display Name and other values that apply.

        You can use the following example problems as models.

        >>How many miles away from Earth is the sun? Use scientific notation to answer.<<

        = 9.3*10^7
        or= 9.296*10^7

        [explanation]
        The sun is 93,000,000, or 9.3*10^7, miles away from Earth.
        [explanation]

        >>The square of what number is -100?<<

        = 10*i

        [explanation]
        -100 is the square of 10 times the imaginary number, i.
